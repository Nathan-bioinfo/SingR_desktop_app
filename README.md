**Please notice that this application is still under development and all features may not work as expected**
This is the ready to use version (for windows only) of my single cell analyzis application. The R files are available here https://github.com/Nathan-bioinfo/SingR/blob/main/README.md if you prefer to user R instead.
## Launch
Download the whole folder SingR_desktop_app and extract it on your computer (right click on the zip folder, and press excrtact all). Go inside the dezziped folder to run SingR.exe by double clicking it. A windows should open quickly. If nothing appears on the window, hit View tab and press "force reload".
